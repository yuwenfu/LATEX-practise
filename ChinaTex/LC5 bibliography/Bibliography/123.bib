 abstract = {电子封装技术是MEMS产品生产中的多项关键技术之一,封装技术及封装质量直接影响产品的电性能、可靠性以及耐久性等性能。通常,MEMS器件封装形式包括全气密封装、塑料封装、WLP(晶圆级封装)、预成型封装以及BGA(球栅阵列封装)封装等,论文介绍了全气密封装和WLP,并重点对塑料封装、预成型封装和BGA封装技术及问题进行了研究。本研究内容对提高MEMS器件封装体的可靠性和电气性能,提高MEMS器件的封装良率和降低生产成本都有重要意义。论文内容主要包括:1.研究分析了MEMS器件电子封装的传统塑封工艺流程和预成型封装工艺流程;分析了封装体的结构问题、MEMS器件封装中用到的引线框架、芯片黏结剂及塑封材料的有关问题;对MEMS器件封装中涉及的焊线机、上片机、塑封机等技术设备进行了介绍。2.对MEMS器件封装体电气性能有关键影响的基板设计和引线框架设计进行了较深入研究。以一款BGA基板设计的研究为例,分析了材料性能对基板电气的影响,并进行了仿真研究,研究发现用BT树脂作为封装基板材料能够使基板取得理想的电性能。进行了从基板叠层设计到布线设计,到电气仿真的研究;采用不同的两种方案对同一款基板进行了设计,分析对比了两种设计方案在电气方面的异同和优缺点,研究发现两种方案设计的基板在焊线设计、布线设计、传输延时、RLC参数、信号串扰等方面各有优缺点。3.介绍了QFN引线框架的设计方法,研究了一款QFN引线框架在大焊盘和引脚焊盘方面的改进设计,改进后的引线框架有效提高了MEMS器件封装体后期电气性能的可靠性。4.分析了MEMS器件封装预成型管壳制造中存在的溢胶原因及溢胶对MEMS器件封装体电气性能的影响。从模具型腔、引线框架背面、引线框架正面三个溢胶位置进行了溢胶的分析研究,分别提出了溢胶问题解决的技术方案。通过分析封装工艺,协同调整合模力、注塑压力及注塑时间等工艺参数理想的解决了一款用于MEMS器件封装的预成型管壳溢胶问题。},

 abstract = {The developments in structural health monitoring techniques have led to

the invention of various sensors that can be effective damage indicator.

Due to environmental or electromagnetic effects and need for constant

energy source, the traditional sensors are unable to provide accurate

and continuous measurements. In light of these events, new and improved

sensors have been developed, along with wireless technology, to assist

the monitoring process. With the need of detecting more than one damage

parameters, multiplexed sensors have been the main interest of

researchers. This paper deals with the different sensors used for

determination of strain, acceleration and corrosion. A brief comparative

study has been performed and presented in the following review paper.

Multiplexed Fiber optics sensor have proved quite effective for SHM and

proved to be a good competitor with other sensors. Optimum Sensor

Placement technique developed for low level damage diagnosis is Iterated

Improved Reduced System (IIRS) Method.},

 abstract = {Laser peen forming (LPF) is a non-contact sheet metal forming process,

in which a laser-induced shock wave is utilized to accurately bend,

shape, precision-align, adjust, and/or repair engineering components.

Due to its combination of exceptional manufacturing advantages,

including non-thermal, no hard tooling, high process flexibility and

controllability, and peening effect for enhanced material durability,

LPF has been used for widespread industry applications in aerospace,

automotive, shipbuilding, biomedical devices, microelectronics, and

microelectromechanical system (MEMS). As a state-of-the-art technology,

ongoing investigations are being conducted to improve the efficacy of

LPF. This paper aims at reviewing the research and development status of

LPF. The LPF process design, forming mechanisms, and simulation

methodologies are discussed. The deformation behaviors as affected by

laser processing parameters, including laser intensity, material

thickness, overlapping ratio, and number of scanning tracks, are

reviewed. In addition, the recent advances in femtosecond LPF and

heat-assisted LPF are studied. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
