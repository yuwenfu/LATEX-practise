## About This Theme

This a beamer theme created for The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

## Dependencies

1. Need Beamer (of course)
2. Need picins package in


```{#picins .c}

\texmf-local\tex\latex\local\

```



### Settings

```{#theme .tex}
\usepackage[
    compress,
    %minimal,
    %nonav,
    red,
    %gold,
    %blue,
    numbers,
    %nologo,
    %nominilogo,
    %minilogoleft,
    polyu,
    %comp,
    %forty,
    %seventyfive,
]
{beamerthemeHongKong}
```

+ "compress" option is recommended. It provides a short header and information about slides structure.
+ "minimal" option provides a simplest framework.
+ "nonav" can suppress the navigating buttons on lower right-hand corner.
+ "red" option is the default and the only implemented color option.
+ "gold" option is not ready. It is inspired by the 75th anniversary ceremony. The link to the guidelines are found but dead. I am trying to get the access.
+ "blue" option is ready. It is inspired by the Computing Department 45th anniversary logo.
+ "numbers" option is the page number on the bottom left-hand corner.
+ "nologo" option enables the solo usage of color theme without PolyU logos on title page and headers.
+ "nominilogo" option removes the white mini logo typically on the right of the title bar.
+ "minilogoleft" option moves the mini logo to the left of the title bar.
+ "polyu" option is default option and it enables whether it exist or not.
+ "comp" option is to include the computing logo in the title page and the head banner.
+ "forty" option is to use the Computing Department 40th anniversary logo in the title page and the head banner.
+ "seventyfive" option is to use the PolyU 75th anniversary logo in the title page and the head banner.


## Template

+ CTeX suite was the design target, and CJK is used for the Chinese support.
+ Now it will change to be compiled with texlive 2012 or above.

## About the design

### Layout

The layout of this theme is based on the work done by [Jorg Cassens](http://cassens.org/) and [Till Tantau](http://www.tcs.uni-luebeck.de/mitarbeiter/tantau/) as shown in themes/theme/beamerthemeHongKong.sty.

This PolyU theme is a modification of the [NTNU Beamer theme](http://story.idi.ntnu.no/~cassens/blog/archives/39-A-Beamer-theme-for-NTNU.html). The general layout is same. The only differences are the color set and logos.

The aim of this modification is to create a nice and tidy PolyU theme using NTNU or the shadow style.

### Color

+ The majority of colors are various kinds of deep and light brick red.
+ The RGB values are extracted from PolyU official website before. Though I asked computing office for these files, I got nothing.
+ Now PolyU VI standard is found, but only a little is added into this theme. More needs to be done.
  1. Update color values according to the [PolyU VI](https://www2.polyu.edu.hk/Script/staff/cpa/Identity_Guidelines/).
  2. Check PolyU standard PPT template. Though the whole design will maintain, defects and false usage of polyu elements should be fixed.
