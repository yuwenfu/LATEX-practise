  abstract =      {Miniaturization of fuel cells (FC) can offer a possibility in the field of small energy sources. Many silicon-based technologies can be used to perform micro-fuel cells and, in particular, porous silicon. In this chapter, after general consideration on fuel cells, we describe the state of the art of porous silicon integration in micro-fuel cells. In particular, we show how porous silicon has arisen as a promising material to perform many functions necessary to the core fuel cell such as proton exchange membrane, gas diffusion layer and catalyst support or flow fields. The performances of the several final devices reported in the literature are discussed.},

  abstract =      {A literature survey is made of the various uses of both macroporous and mesoporous silicon in individual microdevices and complex microsystems. The material has been used as a silicon wafer processing tool where it is sacrificial: in a passive role where it provides, for example, thermal or electrical isolation and in an active role where it performs a range of functions. Examples include delivering drugs, sensing, emitting light, storing hydrogen, providing filtration, or having a catalytic role.},
